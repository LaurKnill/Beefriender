This is a simple text game where you are a bee on a journey to befriend other bees. Made in Eclipse

### Summary
- The game exists purely in text displayed in the console/output area
- The player takes the role of a friendly bee in a world full of hostile bees
- The player enters letters to tell their character what to do next
- The player can "explore" and "battle" hostile enemy bees. Successful encounters raise the player's Level.
- Both the player and wild bees have Levels which increases their health and damage stats
- The player can visit the "shop" to purchase "partygear" which is used to raise their Joy during encounters

This is by no means a thrilling game. It's just a small project to practice my Java familiarity.
