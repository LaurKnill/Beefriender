This is a simple text game where you are a bee on a journey to befriend other bees. Made in Eclipse

### Summary
- The game exists purely in text displayed in the console/output area
- The player takes the role of a friendly bee in a world full of hostile bees
- The player enters letters to tell their character what to do next
- The player "Explores" to encounter hostile bees & find "honeydrops" (currency)
- Encounters with hostile bees are similar to battle scenarios, except instead of HP the opponent has "Grumpiness" and the player has "Joy". The player aims to reduce the hostile bee's grumpiness to 0 to win the encounter. The player can raise their own joy by "dancing" which requires partygear
- When a hostile bee is "befriended" the player wins Exp and Honeydrops
- Hostile bees have levels which makes them more difficult to defeat. The player can also raise their own level by winning encounters.
- The player can visit the "shop" to purchase "partygear" which is used to raise their Joy during encounters
